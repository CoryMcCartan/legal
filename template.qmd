# Introduction and Scope of Work {#sec-intro}

\N Paragraph one. Use `\N` at the start of paragraphs that should be numbered.

\N Paragraph two.

# Qualifications  {#sec-qual}

\N A copy of my curriculum vitae is attached as Exhibit \ref{exh:vitae}.

# Summary of Opinions {#sec-summary}

\N Paragraph three. You can reference sections, e.g. @sec-methods, and also Appendices \ref{sec-app-one} and \ref{sec-app-two}, though the latter should be referenced using the `\ref{}` notation from \LaTeX.

# Methodology  {#sec-methods}

# Further Headings

Citations are easy as well, though do not conform to Bluebook style: @metropolis1953 and @marbury.
